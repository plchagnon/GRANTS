# Biochar to improve circularity in agroecosystems

Most research on biochar conducted up to date as approached biochar as yet another soil amendment in a very similar manner as other products have been integrated in farmer's toolkit since the green revolution, that is, with reliance on an external input produced far away, and purchased as any synthetic fertilizer/pesticide. This poses a major challenge regarding the environmental footprint and the cost of biochar. (***** document drivers of biochar costs [feedstock transport, energy for pyrolysis, equipment maintenance, biochar transport,...] and carbon footprint)

In this project, we will explore various axes of circularity involving biochar:

1. **Trap nutrients before they leave the farm**
    - Constructed wetlands
    - Drainage ditches
    - Manure/slurry pit (since those nutrient surpluses will be largely lost to env, may as well sell it as nutrient-enriched biochar?)

2. **Energy circularity**
    - Culture residues (e.g., unsellable material from horticulture) turned into bio-oil, 5$\times$ more energy dense than solid material ([Lindfors et al. 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0961953419302144))
    - Same with prunings from agroforestry or vinelands?
  
3. **Material circularity**
    - Biochar produced from local sources used as feed additives for poultry, swine or bovine...? Agroecological platform Sherbrooke? CH<sub>4</sub> emissions...?
  
4. **Watter "circularity"**
    - Improved WUE in some horticultural systems? E.g., irrigated mineral soils?
    - Close the loops for clean water "in" to clean water "out" by removing nutrients/pesticides/antibiotics from wastewaters

5. **Socio-economic circularity: Local pyrolysis hubs**
    - Cooperative sharing partnerships of pyrolysis facilities in rural economy...?
