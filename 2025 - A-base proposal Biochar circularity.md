# Biochar to improve circularity in agroecosystems

Most research on biochar conducted up to date as approached biochar as yet another soil amendment in a very similar manner as other products have been integrated in farmer's toolkit since the green revolution, that is, with reliance on an external input produced far away, and purchased as any synthetic fertilizer/pesticide. This poses a major challenge regarding the environmental footprint and the cost of biochar. (***** document drivers of biochar costs [feedstock transport, energy for pyrolysis, equipment maintenance, biochar transport,...] and carbon footprint)

In this project, we will explore various axes of circularity involving biochar:

1. **Trap nutrients before they leave the farm**
    - Constructed wetlands
    - Drainage ditches
    - Manure/slurry pit (since those nutrient surpluses will be largely lost to env, may as well sell it as nutrient-enriched biochar?)

2. **Energy circularity**
    - Culture residues (e.g., unsellable material from horticulture) turned into bio-oil, 5 $\times$ more energy dense than solid material ([Lindfors et al. 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0961953419302144))
    - Same with prunings from agroforestry or vinelands?
    - ****** Look more into potential collaborations with CANMET Energy centres NRCan (Alberta-Ottawa-Varennes?)
  
3. **Material circularity**
    - Biochar produced from local sources used as feed additives for poultry, swine or bovine...? Agroecological platform Sherbrooke? CH<sub>4</sub> emissions...?
    - Value-added products made from biochar, including pesticides?? Very good review to start from regarding biocidal potential of pyrolysis bio-oils is [Mattos et al. 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165237018306235)... **insecticidal**, **fungicidal**, side-effects on non-target organisms...?
  
4. **Water "circularity"**
    - Improved WUE in some horticultural systems? E.g., irrigated mineral soils?
    - Close the loops for clean water "in" to clean water "out" by removing nutrients/pesticides/antibiotics from wastewaters

5. **Socio-economic circularity: Local pyrolysis hubs**
    - Cooperative sharing partnerships of pyrolysis facilities in rural economy...?



## Nutrient circularity
Agroecosystem nutrient circularity is compromised by two major issues: (1) agroecosystems are nutrient-leaky and (2) nutrients are mostly sourced externally from unsustainable sources. Among the potential avenues to explore are (1) constructed wetlands to explore how substrate biochar and plant biomass turned into biochar could generate a biochar-based amendment allowing the re-cycling of nutrients within the systems from which they were lost. Avoided costs in fertilizer acquisition, plus the benefit of using biochar for the crop, should be quantified. 

Alternatively, could simpler approaches like biochar pouches in tile drainage controle system, at the outlet...?

Another way of recycling agricultural nutrients from the watershed would be to re-capture them from waterbodies, using, e.g., floating biochar bags to remove excess N and mostly P responsible for eutrophication...?

Finally, could biochar capture not only nutrients, but also antibiotics from manure pits? See [Mahrhaki & Mao 2022](https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jeq2.20331) for example with wastewater treatment... Very cool paper by [Hagemann et al. (2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01123-0) about organic coatings in biochar that may enhance its capacity to act as an efficient soil amendment at **LOW** concentrations (cite other papers in this direction in end of their discussion). So may favour adoption by developing technologies reducing need for enormous quantities of biochar...? New edition (3rd, 2024) of Lehmann's and Joseph's book has a chapter on biochar as feed additive, ch29 Hegarty et al.!

## Energy circularity
[Lu and Hanandeh (2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652618337272) have suggested that bio-oil had a better environmental footprint and economical benefit than biochar (which was better for GHG reduction), while up to now most of the discussion around pyrolysis has gravitated around biochar as a soil amendment. With higher pyrolysis temperatures, quick exposure time and finely ground materials (because solids have poor thermal conductivity), we can get high bio-oil yields, which is **very** energy-dense. 

Should look at [Brassard et al. (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1537511017302234) for a review on auger pyrolysis apparatus and parameters that impact efficiency and bio-oil production... Project idea could be to look at agroforestry prunings from various **tree species** and evaluate differences in bio-oil yields and chemistry? This could eventually guide as to the potential value of such bio-oil and side-incomes for farmers?

## Material circularity
Sherbrooke RDC prunings from shrub hedgerows and tree prunings could eventually be used as feed-additives for their swine production system? [Schmidt et al. (2019)](https://peerj.com/articles/7373/) present an excellent overview of the use of biochar as feed additive (and also touch on intro about co-applygin with manures, or treat manure pits with biochar for odours and crust...). Biochar in silage can also limit mycotoxin production during fermentation ([Calvelo Pereira et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377840114002247)). [Leng et al. (2013)](https://www.lrrd.org/lrrd25/6/leng25106.htm) showed that biochar type (tested 4 sources) influences its quality as feed additive to reduce cattle CH<sub>4</sub> emissions. Biochar may not only adsorb toxic compounds, but may also have redox properties favouring electron shuttle. This can facilitate electron exchanges with animals fed with energy-rich material needing much electron transport reaction to get energy out of it (so will improve feed efficiency). See [Sun et al. (2017, *Nat. comm*)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14873)...
