## MATTER

#### 1. Sequence AM fungi from the DNA collected in the field, Summer 2024

#### 2. Conduct a pot experiment with fungicide application
Rationale is to track AM fungal development throughout the season with periodic applications of fungicides, with some sacrifice plants sampled few days after each application. This will allow to get information about host plant development. However, without any aboveground inoculation with a pathogen, will plant development really differ across treatment? To be thought further...

## Viromics

#### 1. Soil health from the Frelighsburg vine experimental design

The design needs to be confirmed with Mamadou. Treatments appear to be:

|Treatment|Rang|Entre-rang|
|:---|:-----|:--------|
|Témoin|Herbicide|???|
|Conventionnel|Désherbage mécanique|Sol nu|
|Bio|Désherbage mécanique|Graminées (*Avena sativa* + *Lolium multiflorum*) tondues|
|IWM|Paillis panic érigé|???|

Samplings for end of Summer 2025 (or Spring 2026): each plot = 1 composite rang, 1 composite entre-rang, 5 cores for each composite, 0-15cm

**Soil health indicators to be considered**:
* POXC
* ACE proteins
* Aggregate stability (Yoder + SLAKES)
* M3-P/K/Ca/Na/Mg (look for flame photometer for K-Na-Ca, and test colorimetric for Mg [Methylthymol Blue (MTB) Method])
* C release 4d incubation at XX gravimetric moisture
* Anaerobic N release (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) at XXC in 7d
* pH
* C/N dry combustion

## BIOCHAR

#### **Questions we may want to ask**:

1. **How different biochars and fertilizer fractionation influence nutrient uptake efficiency and mycorrhizal biomass and community structure**

As biochar is expected to adsorb mineral nutrients and release them progressively (see Hagemann et al. 2017 *PLoS One* and other papers by Claudia Kammann), it may act like split fertilizer and mitigate the negative effect of fertilization on (1) AM fungal biomass and community structure (e.g., Johnson et al. 1993 *Ecol Applic*) and (2) soil water quality (potential nutrient losses). We will evaluate this using the following design:

<center>5 biochar conditions (none, and 4 different types) × 3 fertilizer conditions (none, single dose, splitted dose) × 10 reps = 150 pots </center>

For each treatment combination, 3 of the replicates will have micro samplers to collect soil solution right after fertilizer dose application. The crop will be **pepper**, and soil will be a mineral soil from L'Acadie experimental farm. At the end of the experiment, we will measure:

* Plant biomass (aboveground AND belowground)
* Plant [N] (aboveground, vegetative and fruit)
* Plant [P] (same)
* *** With these, $NUE= \left(\frac{\text{Taken up}}{\text{Applied}}\right)$,
$\text{Agron. efficiency}= \left(\frac{\text{Yield fertil. - Yield no fertil.}}{\text{Applied}}\right)$, and $\text{Recovery efficiency}= \left(\frac{\text{Taken up fertil. - Taken up no fertil.}}{\text{Applied}}\right)$
* Soil water solution (4 dates, mirroring split applications) mineral N (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) and P
* RLC at harvest (Lévesque et al. 2020 *Appl Soil Ecol* = 63d?)
* ERM at harvest
* AM fungal DNA for both roots and ERM (ERM isolated instead of taking directly soil)
* Sporulation within a mesh bag filled with sand and same prop of biochar?

2. **How do biochar influence mycorrhizal uptake of labelled N**

As biochar is expected to adsorb strongly mineral nutrients, we could imagine that it will compete with mycorrhizal fungal uptake and transfer to plants. Thus, by varying application rates, we could see a decrease in labelled N (<sup>15</sup>N) transfer to host, and correspondingly a reduction in host investment into AM symbiont? Would require a pure culture system ideally...
