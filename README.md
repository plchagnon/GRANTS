## MATTER

#### 1. Sequence AM fungi from the DNA collected in the field, Summer 2024

#### 2. Conduct a pot experiment with fungicide application
Rationale is to track AM fungal development throughout the season with periodic applications of fungicides, with some sacrifice plants sampled few days after each application. This will allow to get information about host plant development. However, without any aboveground inoculation with a pathogen, will plant development really differ across treatment? To be thought further...

## Viromics

#### 1. Soil health from the Frelighsburg vine experimental design

The design needs to be confirmed with Mamadou. Treatments appear to be:

|Treatment|Rang|Entre-rang|
|:---|:-----|:--------|
|Témoin|Herbicide|???|
|Conventionnel|Désherbage mécanique|Sol nu|
|Bio|Désherbage mécanique|Graminées (*Avena sativa* + *Lolium multiflorum*) tondues|
|IWM|Paillis panic érigé|???|

Samplings for end of Summer 2025 (or Spring 2026): each plot = 1 composite rang, 1 composite entre-rang, 5 cores for each composite, 0-15cm

**Soil health indicators to be considered**:
* POXC
* ACE proteins
* Aggregate stability (Yoder + SLAKES)
* M3-P/K/Ca/Na/Mg (look for flame photometer for K-Na-Ca, and test colorimetric for Mg [Methylthymol Blue (MTB) Method])
* C release 4d incubation at XX gravimetric moisture
* Anaerobic N release (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) at XXC in 7d
* pH
* C/N dry combustion
